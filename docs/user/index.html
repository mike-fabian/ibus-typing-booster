already. Here are some examples for common distributions how you can
install ibus-typing-booster (and optionally emoji-picker) using
package managers on the command line:</p><ul><li>Fedora:<ul><li><code>sudo dnf install ibus-typing-booster</code></li><li><code>sudo dnf install emoji-picker</code> (optional)</li></ul></li><li>Debian, Ubuntu:<ul><li><code>sudo apt-get install ibus-typing-booster</code> (includes emoji-picker already! 😁)</li></ul></li><li>openSUSE:<ul><li><code>sudo zypper install ibus-typing-booster</code> (includes emoji-picker already! 😁)</li></ul></li></ul><p>If your distribution has no binary packages or you are want to have
the bleeding edge version and install from source, see the <a href=../../docs/dev/>Developer
Documentation</a>. There you can also find information on how
to report bugs or translate the user interface into your language.</p><p>Some distributions also have graphical tools to install software
(“Gnome Software”, “Ubuntu Software”, &mldr;). The following video shows
how one can install ibus-typing-booster and emoji-picker on Ubuntu
21.04 using “Ubuntu Software”. “Ubuntu Software” shows
ibus-typing-booster and emoji-picker as two entries, but after
installing ibus-typing-booster, emoji-picker has been installed as
well already, although “Ubuntu Software” does not appear to know that
and still lets me click on “Install” for emoji-picker. But as it was actually
already installed, it finishes immediately 😀.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: when using Gnome, don’t forget to log out of your desktop
and log in again after installing! On most other desktops one can
often avoid that by calling <code>ibus restart</code> from the command line but
on Gnome one has to log out and log in again, otherwise one will not
find ibus-typing-booster when trying to <a href=#1>add it it in the desktop
settings</a>.</p><video playsinline aria-label="Installing using “Ubuntu Software” on Ubuntu 21.04" style=width:100%;height:auto controls>

<source src=../../videos/user-docs/When-using-the-Gnome3-desktop.webm type=video/webm><p>Your browser does not support video.</p></video><p>This video shows how to add ibus-typing-booster to recent Gnome3
desktops, using Gnome3 on Fedora 34 in this example. In older versions
of Gnome3, the input method setup was in the “Region & Language”
settings instead of in the “Keyboard” settings, for example <a href=#1_2>Ubuntu
21.04 has such an older version of Gnome</a>.</p><ol><li><p>First click on the panel menu in the top right corner of the desktop and then click on the “screwdriver and wrench” icon to open the Gnome3 control center.</p></li><li><p>Now the Gnome3 control center has opened. Click on the icon for the “Keyboard” settings.</p></li><li><p>At the bottom you see a list of input sources which have already been added to the desktop before. In this case there are already: “English (US, with euro on 5)” and “Japanese (Kana Kanji)”. This is just an example of course, the list of already added input methods could look different for you. The first entry, “English (US, with euro on 5)”, is not really an input engine, it is just a keyboard layout. One can see that an entry in the list of input sources is a keyboard layout if it does not have the icon showing two tooth-wheels at the right side.</p><p>It is recommended to use a keyboard layout with ibus-typing-booster which has a real “AltGr” key and does not just make the “AltGr” or “Alt” key on the right side of the space bar basically a duplicate of the left “Alt” key. For details, see The <a href=#3_1>“AltGr” key</a>.</p><p>The second entry, “Japanese (Kana Kanji)” is not just a keyboard layout, it is an input engine to type Japanese.</p><p>Now click on the “+” button at the lower left to add another input source.</p></li><li><p>Then click on the three vertical dots “⋮” to open the search entry field.</p></li><li><p>Type the word “booster” into the search entry field. Only “Other” remains. ibus-typing-booster supports many languages, even at the same time. Therefore it is not listed under any specific language but under “Other”.</p></li><li><p>Click on “Other” and you should find an input method named “Other (Typing Booster)” there. There maybe lots of other input methods shown there, depending on what is installed on your system, but if you have ibus-typing-booster installed, “Other (Typing Booster)” should show up there.</p><p>Select “Other (Typing Booster)” and click the “Add” button at the top right.</p><p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you just installed ibus-typing-booster while your current gnome session was still running, you will not find ibus-typing-booster yet. In that case you need to restart your gnome session in order to make newly installed input methods appear in the gnome setup.)</p></li><li><p>Now you you see the ibus-typing-booster engine listed in the “Keyboard” dialogue of Gnome3.</p><p>At the right side of the entry “Other (Typing Booster)” there are three vertical dots “⋮”. If you click on these, a menu opens. One of the entries in that menu is “Preferences”. Clicking that opens the setup tool of the ibus-typing-booster engine.</p></li><li><p>Now open some programs where you could type something, for example “gedit” or “gnome-terminal”. And activate the ibus-typing-booster engine you want to use in the input source menu of the Gnome panel as shown in this screenshot.</p><p>When the input source menu of the Gnome panel is open and an ibus-typing-booster engine is selected, there is a menu entry “Setup” which is an quicker way to open the setup tool than going to the “Region & Language” settings dialogue.</p><p>Some options are also directly available in the input source menu of the gnome panel to have quicker access to these often used options than having to open the setup tool. There are also <a href=#3>key and mouse bindings</a> for these frequently used options which are shown in the input source menu of the gnome panel as well as a reminder.</p></li><li><p>Now type something, for example into gedit and you should see some suggestions for completions.</p><p>At the beginning, the suggestions only come from the hunspell dictionaries and are thus not very good yet. But ibus-typing-booster learns from your typing, it remembers which words you use often in which context. Therefore, the suggestions become much better over time.</p><p>To switch between ibus-typing-booster and other input methods or a simple keyboard layout, you can use the input sources menu in the Gnome panel or the keyboard shortcut, which is Super+Space by default (can be changed in the gnome-control-center).</p></li></ol><h6 id=1_2>1_2</h6><h2 id=when-using-older-gnome3-desktops-like-in-ubuntu-2104>When using older Gnome3 desktops like in Ubuntu 21.04</h2><video playsinline aria-label="Adding ibus-typing-booster to older Gnome3 desktops like in Ubuntu 21.04" style=width:100%;height:auto controls>

<source src=../../videos/user-docs/When-using-other-desktops-than-Gnome3.webm type=video/webm><p>Your browser does not support video.</p></video><p>This chapter shows how to add the ibus-typing-booster input method on most desktops except Gnome3 and Unity. The screenshots in this chapter are using XFCE on Fedora 34, but it is the same procedure on most other desktops and window managers as well, only Gnome3 and Unity are a bit special.</p><ol><li><p>First start the <code>ibus-setup</code> program (For example by typing <code>ibus-setup &</code> into a terminal.</p></li><li><p>If <code>ibus-daemon</code> is not yet running, <code>ibus-setup</code> may ask whether you want to start it. In that case click on “Yes”.</p></li><li><p>If <code>ibus-daemon</code> was not already running, you probably also want to make it run automatically every time when you log into your desktop. If you are using Fedora you can do that for most desktops and window managers using <code>imsettings-switch</code> like this:
<code>imsettings-switch ibus</code>. Or use the graphical tool <code>im-chooser</code> and select to use Ibus.</p></li><li><p>This will change some settings so that when you log in next time, <code>ibus-daemon</code> will be running and the following environment variables will be set:</p><p><code>export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus</code></p><p><code>export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus</code></p><p><code>export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus</code></p></li><li><p>If you don’t use Fedora and do not have the <code>imsettings-switch</code>, there may be some other way to start <code>ibus-daemon</code> on your system automatically and to set the above environment variables.</p><p>Or you can put the above environment variables into your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file and start <code>ibus-daemon</code> from some X11 startup file or make your windowmanager start it. I am using the “i3” windowmanager at the moment and have added the line <code>exec ibus-daemon -drx</code> to my <code>~/.config/i3/config</code> file.</p></li><li><p>In the “General” tab of <code>ibus-setup</code> you see that the default shortcut key to switch between input methods is “Super+Space” and you can change this and some other options if you like.</p><p>Personally I like the extra property panel. Therefore, I set the “Show property panel” option to “Always” here.</p><p>You probably also want the option “Show icon on system tray” switched on.</p><p>And I usually choose a somewhat bigger font to be able to see the details in the emoji better.</p></li><li><p>Now use the “Input Method” tab of <code>ibus-setup</code> to add the ibus-typing-booster engine.</p><p>You see a list of input sources which have already been added to the desktop before. In this case there are already: “English - English (US, euro on 5)” and “Japanese - Anthy”. This is just an example of course, the list of already added input methods could look different for you. The first entry, “English - English (US, euro on 5)”, is not really an input engine, it is just a keyboard layout.</p><p>It is recommended to use a keyboard layout with ibus-typing-booster which has a real “AltGr” key and does not just make the “AltGr” or “Alt” key on the right side of the space bar basically a duplicate of the left “Alt” key. For details, see The <a href=#3_1>“AltGr” key</a>. By the way, in the “Advanced” tab of <code>ibus-setup</code> there is an option “Use system keyboard layout”, if this option is selected, ibus-typing-booster will always use the system keyboard layout, otherwise it will use the keyboard layout from the list of input methods which was used last before switching to ibus-typing-booster.</p><p>The second entry which is already there in the list of input methods, “Japanese (Kana Kanji)”, is a real input engine, not a keyboard layout.</p><p>Now click on the “Add” button at top right to add another input source.</p></li><li><p>Click on the three vertical dots “⋮” at the bottom to get the full list of languages. ibus-typing-booster supports many languages, even at the same time. Therefore it is not listed under any specific language but in the “Other” at the very bottom of the list. You could either scroll down to the “Other” section, click on it and then scroll again looking for “🚀 Typing Booster”, or you could use the search entry and search for “booster” for example.</p></li><li><p>When you find “🚀 Typing Booster”, select it and click the “Add” button.</p></li><li><p>Now the ibus-typing-booster engine has been added to the list of input methods configured in <code>ibus-setup</code>. If you select that “🚀 Typing Booster” in the list of configured input methods in <code>ibus-setup</code>, you can click the “Preferences” button to open the setup tool of the typing-booster engine. There you can customize ibus-typing-booster according to your preferences (You can also open the ibus-typing-booster setup tool later from the menu in the desktop panel).</p></li><li><p>Now open some programs where you could type something, for example “gedit” or “gnome-terminal”. And activate the ibus-typing-booster engine by clicking on the icon for the input methods in the system tray and selecting “Typing booster” there.</p></li><li><p>When the input method menu of system tray icon is open and “Typing booster” is selected, there is a menu entry “Setup” which is a quicker way to open the setup tool of “Typing Booster” then starting <code>ibus-setup</code> again. Some options are also directly available in the input method menu of the system tray icon to have quicker access to these often used options.</p></li><li><p>Near the top right in this video you see the “property panel” which shows the current status of some frequently used options which can also be changed by clicking on the “property panel”. The “property panel” also offers a button to open the setup tool of the ibus-typing-booster engine. You can move that “property panel” to around on your desktop to a convenient place.</p></li><li><p>Now type something, for example into gedit and you should see some suggestions for completions.</p><p>At the beginning, the suggestions only come from the hunspell dictionaries and are thus not very good yet. But ibus-typing-booster learns from your typing, it remembers which words you use often in which context. Therefore, the suggestions become much better over time.</p><p>To switch between ibus-typing-booster and other input methods or a simple keyboard layout, you can use the input methods menu you get by clicking on the system tray icon or you can use the keyboard shortcut, which is Super+Space by default (can be changed using <code>ibus-setup</code>).</p></li></ol><h6 id=1_4>1_4</h6><h2 id=when-using-the-unity-desktop-on-ubuntu-1604>When using the Unity desktop on Ubuntu 16.04</h2><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/When-using-the-Unity-desktop-on-Ubuntu.gif alt="When using the Unity desktop on Ubuntu"></p><p>This section shows the setup of ibus-typing-booster on the “Unity” desktop of ubuntu-16.04.</p><p><span style=color:red>The information in this chapter is pretty old, maybe I should delete it soon.

For ibus-typing-booster >= 2.0.0, all engines have been merged into one, so you won’t find many different “Typing Booster” engines for many different languages anymore, there is only one single “Typing Booster” engine now which supports all languages. That doesn’t make a big difference in these instructions though, so I hope it is not too confusing that the screenshots in this sections are not up-to-date with ibus-typing-booster >= 2.0.0.</p><ol><li><p>Open the system settings by clicking on the icon showing a tooth-wheel and a wrench a the left side of the screen. Then click on the “Language Support” icon there.

<source src=../../videos/user-docs/hindi-locale-default-settings.webm type=video/webm><p>Your browser does not support video.</p></video><p>This video shows how to set languages and input methods in Typing Booster.</p><p>The most important setup in Typing booster is to choose <strong>which</strong>
languages you want to use and <strong>how</strong> to input them.</p><p>ibus-typing-booster works for many languages and it may be necessary
to change the default dictionaries and input methods to different
ones.</p><p>When one uses ibus-typing-booster is started for the very first time,
it checks which locale is set in the environment and initialises its
setup with dictionaries and input methods which are useful for this
locale.</p><p>But it is probably a good idea to open the setup tool and look whether
these defaults are OK for you. You can open the setup tool by
selecting ibus-typing-booster in the input method menu of the panel
and then clicking on the “Setup” menu item in the panel.</p><p>At the beginning, this video shows the default dictionaries and input
methods for the locale “hi_IN.UTF-8” (Hindi in India).</p><p>For this locale, one will get the dictionaries “hi_IN” (Hindi) and
en_GB (British English) and the input methods “hi-inscript2” and
“NoIME” by default. “hi-inscript2” is an input method for
Hindi. “NoIME” means no input method at all, that means the characters
are used as they come from the current keyboard layout without any
transliteration. Having the British English dictionary and the “NoIME”
input method there as well makes it also possible to type English.</p><p>As English is used quite a lot in India, it is probably a good default
for the “hi_IN.UTF-8” locale to setup input for both Hindi and British
English.</p><p>But the defaults guessed from the current locale are not always what a
user wants. A user might use a “en_US.UTF-8” (American English) locale
because he prefers the user interface in English but nevertheless
might want to type Hindi. And even when running in the “hi_IN.UTF-8”
locale, the defaults might not be optimal for some
users. “hi-inscript2” is not the only input method to type Hindi,
there are other choices. And maybe a Hindi user wants to use
additional other languages and input methods completely unrelated to
the current locale.</p><p>So the video shows how to add or remove dictionaries and input methods
and move them up or down to increase or lower the priorities.
The video also shows how the “Input Method Help” button pops up
an explanation what an input method does and how to use it.</p><p>Near the end, the video shows how the “Set to default” buttons can
reset the lists of languages and input methods to the defaults
for the current locale.</p><p>Both lists can hold a maximum of 10 items, i.e. you can have up to 10
dictionaries and 10 input methods. Don’t overdo it though, don’t add
more than you really need, adding more dictionaries and input methods
than one really needs slows down the system and reduces the accuracy
of the word predictions.</p><p>The list of input methods cannot be made completely empty, as soon as
you remove the last input method, the “NoIME” input method is
automatically added back because no input at all makes no sense.</p><p>The list of dictionaries can be made empty though. That doesn’t seem
particularly useful to me, but apparently there are some users who use
ibus-typing-booster mostly as a convenient input method for emoji or
special symbols and in that case one doesn’t need a dictionary.</p><h6 id=2_2>2_2</h6><h2 id=more-advanced-options>More advanced options</h2><p>This chapter explains more advanced options how to adapt the behaviour and the look and feel of ibus-typing-booster to your preferences.</p><h6 id=2_2_1>2_2_1</h6><h2 id=enable-suggestions-by-a-key>Enable suggestions by a key</h2><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/enable-suggestions-by-key.png alt="enable suggestions by key"></p><video playsinline aria-label="Enable suggestions by key" style=width:100%;height:auto controls>
<source src=../../videos/user-docs/enable-suggestions-by-key.webm type=video/webm><p>Your browser does not support video.</p></video><p>This video shows what the options “☑️ Enable suggestions by key” and
“☑️ Use preedit style only if lookup is enabled” do.</p><p>By default, ibus-typing-booster pops up a list of candidates as soon
as you type something and you can choose a candidate to complete the
word you have started typing to save some key strokes, fix a spelling
error, or select an emoji or special character.</p><p>But some users prefer <strong>not</strong> to have these candidate lists displayed all
the time. Maybe they are fast touch typists and usually type without
completion support and the frequent pop up of the candidate lists is
too visually disturbing. Calculating the candidate lists also takes
some time, especially if emoji predictions are enabled. These
calculations may actually interfere with the typing for very fast
typists.</p><p>But from time to time even exceptionally fast typists may still want
to see candidates to complete a very long word or check the spelling
or or input an emoji.</p><p>In that case it can be useful to check the option “☑️ Enable suggestions
by key”.</p><p>If that option is enabled, no candidate list is shown unless a special
key is pressed to request a candidate list. By default that special
key is Tab but this can be changed by the <a href=#3_4>customizing the keys</a>
bound to the command “enable_lookup”.</p><p>In the beginning of the video, this option is <strong>not</strong> enabled. When typing
into the text editor one sees that after each single key typed a suggestion
list with word completions pops up.</p><p>Then the option “☑️ Enable suggestions by key” is enabled. Now when
typing into the text editor, no suggestions pop up unless Tab is pressed.
So one sees that “Hello Worl” is typed without andy suggestions popping up,
then Tab is pressed and suggestions containing “World” pop up.</p><p>There is another option “Minimum number of chars for completion” which
is 1 by default. If that option is set to a number greater than 1,
then a candidate list appears automatically only when that number of
characters has been typed into the preedit. But using the keys bound
to the “enable_lookup” command one can still request a candidate list
even if fewer characters have been typed.</p><p>Some users using this option to show candidate lists only on request,
request candidate lists only very rarely to complete an unusually long
and complicated word or to type an emoji. When candidate lists are
requested only very infrequently, some users dislike that the preedit,
i.e. the currently typed word, is always underlined. It is possible to
disable the underlining of the preedit in the “Appearance” tab of the
setup tool: There is a combobox where one can choose no underlining
for the preedit.</p><p>But one does not have to disable the underlining of the preedit
completely: It is even possible to hide the underline indicating the
preedit only as long as no candidate list is requested. To do this,
there is the option “Use preedit style only if lookup is enabled” in
the Appearances tab of the setup tool. Then the preedit looks like
normal text until a candidate list is requested. As soon as the
candidate list is requested, the preedit is again styled (usually
underlined), this makes it clearer which part of the text has been
used to calculate that candidate list. The use of this option
is also shown near the end of the video.</p><p><strong>Attention when using Wayland</strong>: Currently it is not possible to do any
style changes to the preedit on Wayland. On Wayland the preedit is
always underlined and always has the same foreground and background
colour as normal text, no matter what options to influence the preedit
style are chosen in the setup tool of ibus-typing-booster. That is a
missing feature in Wayland.</p><h6 id=2_2_1_1>2_2_1_1</h6><h2 id=simulate-the-behaviour-of-ibus-m17n>Simulate the behaviour of ibus-m17n</h2><video playsinline aria-label="Simulating ibus-m17n (hi-itrans)" style=width:100%;height:auto controls>
<source src=../../videos/user-docs/simulating-ibus-m17n-hi-itrans.webm type=video/webm><p>Your browser does not support video.</p></video><p>This video shows how one can emulate ibus-m17n using
ibus-typing-booster by switching off all the features
ibus-typing-booster has in addition to ibus-m17n.</p><p>The ibus-m17n engines can be used to input many languages using all
the input methods from m17n-lib and m17n-db.</p><p>ibus-typing-booster can also use the same input methods from m17n-lib
and m17n-db. So one can input all the languages in the same way one
can with ibus-m17n. But ibus-typing-booster has many additional
features like completion using dictionaries, spellchecking,
predictions based on previous user input and being able to use several
input methods/transliterations at the same time.</p><p>But what if a user doesn’t need and want all the extra features of
ibus-typing-booster at all, just simple type one language with one
input method without any extra bells and whistles?</p><p>One can still use ibus-typing-booster in that case by disabling all of
the extra features. Then ibus-typing-booster behaves like any
ibus-m17n engine.</p><p>The advantage of simulating ibus-m17n using ibus-typing-booster is
that there are probably fewer bugs because ibus-typing-booster is more
actively maintained.</p><p>To simulate ibus-m17n with ibus-typing-booster, one can use the
following setup options:</p><ul><li>Dictionaries and input methods tab:<ul><li>Remove all input methods except the one you want to use</li></ul></li><li>Options tab:<ul><li>Check the option “Enable suggestions by key”</li><li>Check the option “Off the record mode”</li></ul></li><li>Key bindings tab:<ul><li>Remove all keys bound to the command “enable_lookup”</li></ul></li><li>Appearance tab:<ul><li>Set “Preedit underline” to “None”</li></ul></li></ul><p>With these settings, no candidate lists will ever pop up because one
would need to press a key to enable a suggestion but all such keys
have been removed from the “enable_lookup” command. So candidate lists
are never shown, just like in ibus-m17n.</p><p>No user input is recorded because of enabling the option “Off the
record mode”. Recording user input would be useless because stuff
learned from user input is normally used to improve the quality of the
suggestions based on previous input. But if there are never any
suggestions, there is no need to record user input at all.</p><p>Without candidate lists, dictionaries are useless, therefore it
doesn’t matter which dictionaries are setup in the “Dictionaries and
input methods” tab. One can remove them all or leave them there, it
doesn’t matter.</p><p>As one can see in the video, setting the above options one after another,
ibus-typing-booster behaves more and more similar to ibus-m17n, when
all above options are set, the behaviour looks identical.</p><h6 id=2_2_2>2_2_2</h6><h2 id=use-inline-completion>Use inline completion</h2><video playsinline aria-label="“Normal” completion versus inline completion" style=width:100%;height:auto controls>
<source src=../../videos/user-docs/inline-completion.webm type=video/webm><p>Your browser does not support video.</p></video><p>The video above shows how “inline completion” looks like compared to
“normal” completion.</p><p>Very often, the first candidate shown as a suggestion is already the
desired one, especially after having used ibus-typing-booster for a
while and it has learned what the user types often in what context.</p><p>When one ends up selecting the first candidate most of the time,
popping up a candidate list with more candidates all the time is
needlessly visually distracting.</p><p>When the option “Use inline completion” is checked, the first and most
likely candidate is shown inline at the writing position without
popping up a candidate list. The characters one has already typed are
shown in the current foreground colour (black in the screenshot) and
are underlined (Unless underlining the preedit has been switched off
in the “Apperance” settings). The completion which is suggested is
shown without the underline and in a different colour. This colour is
gray by default because this works in most cases, it also works when
the foreground text colour is white and the background black. The
colour to be used for the inline completion can be chosen in the
“Appearance” tab. One can also choose not to use a different colour,
then the only difference in style between the completion and the
already typed characters is the missing underline under the
completion.</p><p>This inline completion style looks much nicer than always popping up a
candidate list when the predictions are fairly good and the first
candidate is often the desired one.</p><p>If that first candidate shown inline is what one wants, one can select
it by typing any of the keys bound to the “select_next_candidate”
command (Tab and arrow down by default).</p><p>When the candidate is selected, the style of the completion becomes
the same as the style of the already typed characters and the cursor
moves to the end of the completion.</p><p>Now one could commit it for example by typing space and continue
typing the next word of the text.</p><p>Or, if that candidate displayed inline happens to be not the desired
one, it is still possible to pop up a full candidate list with more
candidates by pressing the key bound to the “select_next_candidate”
command (Tab by default) again. And then walk down the candidate list
by continue pressing that key. If nothing appropriate can be found in
the whole candiate list, one can use the key bound to the command
“cancel” (the Escape key by default) to deselect all candidates and
close the candidate list. Then one could type more input characters
and hope that better suggestions become available after typing a bit
more.</p><p>One can also ignore the candidate displayed inline completely and just
continue typing more input characters until a better candidate is
displayed.</p><h6 id=2_2_3>2_2_3</h6><h2 id=inline-completion-is-hard-to-use-on-wayland>Inline completion is hard to use on Wayland</h2><video playsinline aria-label="Inline completion is hard to use on Wayland" style=width:100%;height:auto controls>

colour as normal text, no matter what options to influence the preedit
style are chosen in the setup tool of ibus-typing-booster. That is a

Wayland. It is possible to use it, but as the characters typed and the
suggested completion are displayed in exactly the same style, it is
quite hard to see what has been typed and what is the completion. If
one looks carefully, one can still see it because the cursor can be
seen at the end of the typed characters, everything to the right of
the cursor is the suggested completion. If the completion is selected
by typing the key bound to the “select_next_candidate” command (Tab by
default), then the cursor moves to the end of the completion.</p><p>One can get used to the fact that the difference between the typed
text and the inline completion is hard to see on Wayland, but I found
this to be quite hard.</p><h6 id=2_2_3-1>2_2_3</h6><h2 id=spellchecking>Spellchecking</h2><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/spellchecking-preedit-and-candidate-list.png alt=spellchecking-preedit-and-candidate-list></p><p>ibus-typing-booster also does spellchecking (Using hunspell for most languages and voikko for Finnish).</p><p>If a word is typed which might contain a spelling error, the candidate list of suggestions may contain suggestions for spelling corrections, i.e. words which are not just completing the text already typed to something longer or fixing some accents but “seriously” changing the characters already typed, more than just fixing accents, i.e. completely different characters or another order of characters.</p><p>Optionally, such spellchecking suggestions can be marked in the candidate list with a symbol or using a different colour in the candidate list. The symbol and color can be chosen.</p><p>One can also choose to mark candidates which are (accent insensitive) completions of the typed word with a symbol and/or colour if they are valid words in one of the dictionaries.</p><p>And one can choose to mark candidates which are (accent insensitive) completions of the typed word with a symbol and/or colour if they have been remembered in the user database because the user has typed them before.</p><p>All of these markings can help to get the spelling right, for example if one uses a French dictionary and types “egali” and sees “égalité” and “égalisation” marked as “dictionary suggestions” in the candidate list, then one knows that these candidates are valid words in the French dictionary and what one typed was identical to the beginning of these candidates except for differents in accents.</p><p>It can also speed up typing not bothering typing the accents at all (because this often requires extra key strokes) and then select the correctly accented word from one of the “dictionary suggestions”.</p><p>Colour in the candidate list does not work when using Gnome, only on other desktops colour can be used in the candidate list. Marking spellchecking suggestions with a symbol also works on Gnome. By default, neither colour nor symbols are used for suggestions.</p><h4 id=indicating-spelling-errors-in-the-preedit>Indicating spelling errors in the preedit</h4><p>One can choose that the preedit changes colour when the typed word is not a valid word in any of the dictionaries setup in the ”Dictionaries and input methods” tab of the setup tool.</p><p>For example, if one uses an English and a French dictionary, and the typed word in the preedit is neither a valid word in English nor in French, then the preedit changes colour. This is also shown in the above screenshot using the default colour red.</p><p>Dictionaries where spellchecking is not supported are ignored for this colour change. For example, if one uses an English, a French, and a Japanese dictionary at the same time, the preedit still changes colour if the word is neither a valid English nor a valid French word. Whether the typed word is in the Japanese dictionary or not doesn’t matter because the Japanese dictionary does not support spellchecking.</p><p>Attention when using Wayland: On Wayland it is not possible to indicate a possible spelling error in the preedit.</p><p>Currently it is not possible to do any style changes to the preedit on Wayland.

Ibus-typing-booster supports using more than one dictionary and more than one input method/transliteration at the same time.</p><p>That makes it possible to write text in more than one language without having to switch languages manually. If one often writes in different languages this can save a lot of input method switching.</p><p>This works not only when the languages use same script (like using English and Spanish at the same time), it works even when the languages use different scripts. For example when using English (Latin script) and Hindi (Devanagari script) at the same time. When using languages with different scripts at the same time, it is sometimes necessary to switch the input method for the preëdit (See the Hindi and English example). But even in such a more complicated case, switching is often not necessary, often one can select a suitable candidate without switching and save a lot of input method switches.</p><ol><li><p>This screenshot shows how dictionaries can be added using the “+” button below the list of dictionaries in the “Dictionaries and input methods” tab of the setup tool.</p><p>The check marks (“✔️”) and the cross marks (“❌”) indicate whether a spellchecking dictionary and/or and emoji dictionary for that language/locale is currently available on your system.

When clicking that black box, the package manager will try to install packages for the missing dictionaries, if possible. For “fr_FR” (French) this will succeed on Fedora 29 and install the “hunspell-fr” package. For “zh” (Chinese) and “ja_JP” Japanese this will not succeed, there are no hunspell dictionaries for these languages on Fedora 29. That does not mean that adding the “zh” and “ja_JP” dictionaries in the setup tool is pointless, the check mark (“✔️”) is shown after emoji. That means emoji dictionaries for these languages are available and even installed at the moment. So if you want to match emoji in Chinese or Japanese, these dictionaries could still be useful.</p></li></ol><h6 id=4_1>4_1</h6><h3 id=example-using-hindi-and-english-at-the-same-time>Example using Hindi and English at the same time</h3><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/Example-using-Hindi-and-English-at-the-same-time.gif alt=Example-using-Hindi-and-English-at-the-same-time>

Then one can just type in either Hindi or English and ibus-typing-booster will show suitable candidates automatically.</p><ol><li><p>This screenshot shows how to setup ibus-typing-booster to use Hindi and English at the same time.</p><p>In the “Dictionaries and input methods” tab of the setup tool one can see that two dictionaries have been added, “hi_IN” for Hindi and “en_GB” for British English.</p><p>And two input methods have been added, “hi-itrans” to type Hindi and “NoIme” (“Native Keyboard”, i.e. direct keyboard input) to type English.</p><p>There are several input methods available for Hindi: “hi-inscript2”, “hi-inscript”, “hi-phonetic”, “hi-itrans”, “hi-remington”, “hi-typewriter”, and “hi-vedmata”. In this example we use “hi-itrans” but one could also use any of the others or even several at once.</p></li><li><p>If more than one input/transliteration method is enabled, the typed keys will be transliterated with each transliteration method and each transliteration result will be looked up in the enabled dictionaries and in the user database of previous input.</p><p>In this screenshot, Hindi with the “hi-itrans” method and English are used at the same time. One can see that the input “guru” has been typed. The candidate list shows both “गुरु” (which is the transliteration of the input “guru” using the “hi-itrans” method) and the English candidates “guru” and “gurus”. This is because both the transliteration “गुरु” and the direct input “guru” are used at the same time to lookup candidates.</p><p>Actually it is quite rare to see candidates from both Hindi and English in a candidate list. The English word “guru” is a loanword from Hindi, it is just the transliteration of the original Hindi word into the Latin Alphabet. Therefore, the “Itrans” method transliterates it back to Hindi and one gets a match in Hindi as well. Most English words do not transliterate to anything meaningful in Hindi and most Hindi input does not match anything in English either. The example “guru” is carefully chosen to show how ibus-typing-booster handles multilingual input.</p><p>In practice, as soon as one has typed a few characters, one will most of the time see only candidates from either Hindi or English, not both. I.e. the language one is typing in at the moment is automatically detected because one very rarely gets matches in the other language.</p><p>This automatic language detection works even better after ibus-typing-booster has learned from user input for a while. Because ibus-typing-booster remembers the context where the user has typed words.</p></li><li><p>This screenshot uses the same setup, Hindi (“hi-itrans”) and English. The same input “guru” has been typed and the matches shown in the candidate list are the same.</p><p>The difference is that the “hi-itrans” transliteration “गुरु” is shown in the preëdit this time (preëdit is the current input, i.e. the underlined text next to the candidate list). And in the status line above the first candidate, one can see “hi-itrans”.</p><p>The reason for this difference is that for this screenshot, the input method to be used for the preëdit has been switched to “hi-itrans”.</p><p>Switching the input method for the preëdit is sometimes necessary because one may not want to select any of the displayed candidates but commit the preëdit instead by typing a space. For example, if the preëdit is currently in English mode (direct input mode) and one types a Hindi word, it may happen that one does not get any matches in the candidate list, although the word has been typed correctly. This may happen if this word can neither be found in the dictionary nor in the user database because this word has never been typed before by the user. Nevertheless it may be a correct Hindi word of course and the user may want to commit it. But if the preëdit is currently in English mode, typing space would commit the Latin characters. So one has to switch the preëdit to “hi-itrans” first and then commit by typing a space.</p><p>The key bindings to switch the input method for the preëdit are “Control+Down” and “Control+up”. With only two input methods as in the current example, both key bindings behave the same. But there can be more than two input methods and then “Control+Down” moves in one direction through the list of input methods and “Control+Up” in the other direction (see <a href=#3>key and mouse bindings</a>).</p></li><li><p>This screenshot shows the options tab of the setup tool and the options for ibus-typing-booster in the input method menu of the gnome panel.</p><p>As an alternative to using the “Control+Down” and “Control+Up” key bindings, the input method for the preëdit can also be switched using the menu in the gnome panel.</p><p>In the setup tool, there is an option “Remember last used preëdit input method”. If that option is disabled, ibus-typing-booster will always start using the input method with the highest priority in the setup tool for the preëdit when you log in to your desktop and use ibus-typing-booster for the first time after the login. In our setup shown in the previous screenshot, the input method with the highest priority is “NoIme”, i.e. direct keyboard input. If the option to remember the last used preëdit input method is enabled, ibus-typing-booster will change the priority in the setup when you switch to a different input method for the preëdit using the key bindings or the Gnome panel. That way, ibus-typing-booster will remember which input method was used last when you logged out of your desktop and start using that the next time you log in.</p></li></ol><h6 id=4_2>4_2</h6><h3 id=example-using-spanish-and-english-at-the-same-time>Example using Spanish and English at the same time</h3><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/Example-using-Spanish-and-English-at-the-same-time.gif alt=Example-using-Spanish-and-English-at-the-same-time></p><ol><li><p>This example shows using ibus-typing-booster for Spanish and English at the same time. In the setup tool, dictionaries for Spanish (“es_ES”) and British English (“en_GB”) have been added. And two input methods “t-latn-pre” and “NoIme” (Native Keyboard, i.e. direct keyboard input) have been added. Actually using only “NoIme” would have been enough, both Spanish and English can be typed just fine with direct keyboard input with a suitable keyboard layout. Adding “t-latin-pre” makes it possible to type for example “~n” to get an “ñ”, i.e. using “t-latn-pre” one can type accented Latin charaters even when using a US English keyboard layout for example. But that is completely optional, one can use only “NoIme”, only “t-latn-pre”, or both, depending on what keyboard layout one wants to use and what is most convenient.</p><p>The input typed is “Yo soy un h” where the last character, the “h” is still in preëdit (marked by the underline) and we see some suggestions how the word starting with “h” might continue.</p><p>The suggestions shown are Spanish words, not English. This is because ibus-typing-booster has already been trained by similar user input before. Therefore, it already knows which word starting with “h” the user usually types following “soy un”. And these are Spanish words.</p></li><li><p>This screenshot shows how the user continues to type some English after finishing the Spanish sentence.</p><p>The input typed is now “I am h” and again the last character “h” is still in preëdit and some suggestions for words starting with “h” are shown.</p><p>This time, the suggestions for words starting with “h” are English, not Spanish. This is because the words typed before were “I am” and the user apparently types the suggested English words frequently after “I am”.</p><p>So ibus-typing-booster can often automatically show candidates from the correct language according to the context. This makes it quite efficient to type multiple languages.</p><p>One can add as many dictionaries as one likes, but adding more dictionaries than one really needs slows the system down unnessarily and reduces the prediction accuracy.</p></li></ol><h6 id=5>5</h6><h2 id=unicode-symbols-and-emoji-predictions>Unicode symbols and emoji predictions</h2><p>ibus-typing-booster supports prediction of emoji and Unicode symbols as well (actually almost all Unicode characters except letters can be typed this way). This can be enabled or disabled with the option “Emoji predictions” in the setup tool which is on by default.</p><p>To make all emoji display correctly, you need good fonts which contain all emoji, see Emoji fonts for details about available fonts and font setup.</p><h6 id=5_1>5_1</h6><h3 id=emoji-input>Emoji input</h3><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-english-castle.png alt=gnome-emoji-english-castle></p><p>When the emoji option is on (it is off by default), you get emoji displayed in the candidate list automatically when typing something which matches an emoji.</p><p>For example in this screenshot, the user has typed “castle” and the emoji 🏰 (U+1F3F0 EUROPEAN CASTLE) is shown as the last candidate of the first page of the candidate list.</p><p>If reasonable matches for emoji are found, the first match is shown as the last candidate of the first page of the candidate list. If more than one emoji has matched the input, the other matches can be found by scrolling down to the next page of candidates. If an emoji is selected and committed, it will be remembered just like ibus-typing-booster remembers other words and will be shown with higher priority next time.</p><p>The screen shot shows coloured emoji, to make that work see <a href=#5_10>Showing emoji in colour</a>. By default, emoji will be shown in black and white on current linux distributions.</p><h6 id=5_2>5_2</h6><h2 id=emoji-input-fuzzy-matching>Emoji input fuzzy matching</h2><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-english-fuzzy-castle.png alt=gnome-emoji-english-fuzzy-castle>
ibus-typing-booster tries to match the emoji names in a fuzzy way, in many cases you will get a match even if your input contains spelling mistakes.</p><p>In this example, the typed input is “casle”, i.e. not spelled correctly. Nevertheless, one gets the match 🏰 (U+1F3F0 EUROPEAN CASTLE).</p><h6 id=5_3>5_3</h6><h3 id=emoji-input-using-multiple-keywords>Emoji input using multiple keywords</h3><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-english-multiple-keywords-castle-japanese.png alt>
If typing a single word does not give you the emoji you are looking for, you can type as many keywords as you like and concatenate them with underscores “_” (Or spaces “ ”. Typing space usually commits the preëdit, but you can insert literal spaces into the preëdit by typing AltGr+Space).</p><p>In a previous example, typing “castle” gave us the match 🏰 (U+1F3F0 EUROPEAN CASTLE). If this is not what we wanted we can type “castle_japanese” (or “japanese_castle”) to get 🏯 (U+1F3EF JAPANESE CASTLE). Even “castlejapanese” and “japanesecastle” work in this case, but separating the search words with underscores or spaces makes it easier for the matching algorithm.</p><h6 id=5_4>5_4</h6><h3 id=looking-up-related-emoji>Looking up related emoji</h3><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-english-related-japanese-castle.png alt></p><p>It is also possible to look up related emoji which may not have matched the typed text well but are related to the emoji shown because they share keywords or categories.</p><p>To show related emoji, click an emoji shown in the candidate list with the right mouse button (see Mouse bindings).</p><p>Or, if you prefer to use a key binding instead of the mouse: select an emoji in the candidate list by moving up or down in the candidate list using the arrow-up/arrow-down keys or the page-up/page-down keys until the desired emoji is highlighted, then press AltGr+F12.</p><p>AltGr+F12 is the key binding to “lookup related stuff”. If you press this while no candidate is selected, a lookup of related stuff for the preëdit is tried. In this case, the preëdit contains the text “castle” which is not an emoji. So no related emoji will be found. But if NLTK is used, related words for “castle” may be shown, see Using NLTK to find related words.</p><p>As seen in the screen shot, looking up related emoji for the “Japanese castle” gives us emoji for other types of castles or buildings. The lists of words shown in square brackets are the keywords the shown emoji have in common with the originally selected emoji. By typing the “Escape” key, one can go back to the original list.</p><h6 id=5_5>5_5</h6><h3 id=multilingual-emoji-input>Multilingual emoji input</h3><h6 id=5_5_1>5_5_1</h6><h4 id=emoji-input-using-german-and-english>Emoji input using German and English</h4><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-german-english-schloss-europa.png alt=gnome-emoji-german-english-schloss-europa></p><ol><li><p>In this example, the German typing booster is used with English as a second language. Therefore, one can use both the English word “castle” or the German word for castle “Schloss” to find castle emoji.</p><p>In the screen shot, the input typed is “Schloss_europa” and the emoji matches shown are 🏰 (U+1F3F0 EUROPEAN CASTLE), 🔒 (U+1F512 LOCK), and 🏯 (U+1F3EF JAPANESE CASTLE).</p><p>The German word “Schloss” can mean “castle” as well as “lock”. Therefore, the padlock emoji 🔒 (U+1F512 LOCK) matches as well.</p></li></ol><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-german-english-geschlossenes-schloss-related.png alt=gnome-emoji-german-english-geschlossenes-schloss-related></p><ol><li>Let’s look up related emoji by clicking the candidate number 5, “Geschlossenes Schloss” 🔒 (U+1F512 LOCK) with the right mouse button (See Looking up related Emoji).</li></ol><p>We get several variants of padlock emoji, the European castle and some closed mailboxes because “geschlossen” in German can also mean “closed”.</p><p>By the way, the related emoji shown in the screen shot have German names and keywords. That’s because this example uses German as the main language for ibus-typing-booster with English as a second language (See Multilingual input). When looking up related emoji, they are shown in all languages ibus-typing-booster is setup to use, but they are sorted in the order of preference of the languages. So German is on top because it is the main language. To see emoji whose English keywords are related to the emoji 🔒 (U+1F512 LOCK), one can scroll further down in the candidate list. These are of course labelled in English.</p><h6 id=5_5_2>5_5_2</h6><h4 id=emoji-input-using-hindi-and-english>Emoji input using Hindi and English</h4><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-namaste.png alt=gnome-emoji-namaste></p><ol><li><p>This screenshot shows another example using Hindi as the main language and English as a second language.</p><p>The input typed is “namaste”, with the transliteration method “hi-itrans” this is transliterated to “नमस्ते” which is currently shown in the preëdit (For details about multilingual input and how to switch the script shown in the preëdit, see Multilingual input).</p><p>Both “namaste” and “नमस्ते” are used to search for matching words and emoji.

On Fedora 28 one can do this using the command:</p><p><code>sudo dnf install m17n-db-extras m17n-lib-anthy</code></p><p>This should work on other distributions as well, but the package names may be different. You need the package which contains the <code>/usr/share/m17n/ja-anthy.mim</code> file and other packages which are required to make the ja-anthy input method of the m17n library work.</p><p>Then one needs to add the “ja-anthy” input method and the Japanese dictionary (“ja_JP”) to the setup of ibus typing booster.

The Latin “katatsumuri” was transliterated by the ja-anthy input method to “かたつむり” and this was then looked up in the dictionaries.

Especially if the emoji lookup is done in multiple languages at the same time. In this case, there may be a noticeable delay until the candidate list pops up.</p><p>Therefore, one may want to switch emoji mode off for maximum speed.</p><p>Always opening the setup tool to switch emoji mode on if one occasionally wants to input an emoji would be inconvenient. Therefore, emoji mode can also be toggled with a mouse binding (Control+Button3 anywhere in the candidate list toogles emoji mode between on and off) or with a key binding (AltGr+F6 toggles emoji mode between on and off).</p><p>But there is an even faster way to temporarily switch on emoji mode just for the current lookup.</p><p>In this screenshot we can see that emoji mode is off because the box to the left of the smiley above the candidate list is not checked (and one can see that “Unicode symbols and emoji predictions” is not checked in the setup tool either).</p><p>Nevertheless we get matches for two camel emoji.

The info popover shown on right mouse click shows which font was used for which part of the sequence which is helpful to debug such problems.</li></ul><p>“emoji-picker” has some command line options to choose the languages, the font and the fontsize. For example, emoji-picker &ndash;languages de:en:fr would enable you to use German, English, and French to browse and search for emoji and display the names of the emoji in all of these languages. If the command line option is not used, the languages are taken from the environment variables. The LANGUAGE variable works as well.

On Fedora, this font is in the “google-noto-emoji-fonts” package, on openSUSE in the “noto-coloremoji-fonts” package. If the version packaged for your distribution is not up-to-date, you can get the most recent version here: <a href=https://www.google.com/get/noto/>https://www.google.com/get/noto/</a>. (Search for “Noto Color Emoji”).</p><p>Without the experimental Cairo patch (See <a href=#5_10_1>Showing emoji in colour</a>), the “Noto Color Emoji” font will render in grayscale, but even that looks much better already than fonts wich render only in black and white.</p><p>“emoji-picker” will use the “Noto Color Emoji” font by default, if it is installed. To make sure that “Noto Color Emoji” is also your preferred font for emoji in other programs and not only in “emoji-picker”, you can use a fontconfig setup as in this <a href=../../other-files/fonts.conf>example fonts.conf</a> file. file and store the file at <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code>.</p><p>If you do not yet have a <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts</code>.conf file, create one with the contents as above. If you already have such a file but no “alias” settings exist, add the part defining the aliases. Or if you already have “alias” settings in your <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> file, edit them.</p><p>“DejaVu Serif”, “DejaVu Sans”, and “DejaVu Sans Mono”, are just examples, put your favorite fonts for Latin and other scripts below the fonts for emoji in the <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> setup file.</p><p>If you don’t give a good emoji font like “Noto Color Emoji” the highest priority in the fontconfig setup, the highest priority font may be a font which already has some emoji. For example, “DejaVu Sans” already has many emoji, but not all. I.e. when “DejaVu Sans” has highest priority and is tried first, all emoji which are available in “DejaVu Sans” are shown using that font and only those which are missing in “DejaVu Sans” are shown using the “Noto Color Emoji” font. That means you will see the some emoji displayed using the “DejaVu Sans” font and some using the “Noto Color Emoji” font which will look very inconsistent. It looks nicer using “Noto Color Emoji” for all emoji which can be achieved by giving “Noto Color Emoji” the highest priority.</p><p>The Latin characters in some emoji fonts may not be really suitable to be used as a default Latin font. For example, the “Symbola” font has Latin glyphs with serifs. Nevertheless, putting an emoji font like “Noto Color Emoji”, “Emoji One”, or “Symbola” with top priority into the <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> setup file does usually not cause any problems.</p><p>Your desktop, editor, terminal, … will most likely set some other font anyway. For example, the Gnome3 desktop usually sets the “Cantarell” font, i.e. Gnome3 will still use “Cantarell” even if you give the “Symbola” font highest priority in <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> (You can change the font used for the Gnome3 desktop with <code>gnome-tweak-tool</code>. The same is true for most other desktops and programs.</p></li></ol><p><img src=../../images/user-docs/gnome-emoji-one-grayscale.png alt=gnome-emoji-one-grayscale></p><ol><li><p>Another good emoji font is the “Emoji One” font which you can get from here: <a href=https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/master/assets/fonts/emojione-android.ttf>https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/master/assets/fonts/emojione-android.ttf</a></p><p>The “Emoji One” font also looks very nice but currently supports fewer emoji sequences than the latest version of “Noto Color Emoji”. For example, the emoji sequence 👷‍♀ (👷 U+1F477 CONSTRUCTION WORKER, U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER, ZERO WIDTH JOINER, ♀ U+2640 FEMALE SIGN) will display as several glyphs and not as a single glyph showing a female construction worker. But many emoji sequences do work with this font. And many (but not all) skin tone modifiers work as well with the “Emoji One” font.</p><p>If you want to make “Emoji One” your preferred font for emoji in all programs and not only in “emoji-picker”, you can edit the fontconfig setup from this example <a href=../../other-files/fonts.conf>example fonts.conf</a> file and move the lines containing “Emoji One” above the lines containing “Noto Color Emoji”.

Best use the latest version, at least the version updated for Unicode 9.0.0. On Fedora and openSUSE, this font is in the “gdouros-symbola-fonts” package. Fedora 25 already has the Unicode 9.0.0 version. If you are using Fedora 24, better update that font.</p><p>But even the latest version of the black and white “Symbola” font does not support any emoji which consist of more than one character. That means emoji sequences like 👷‍♀ (👷 U+1F477 CONSTRUCTION WORKER, U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER, ZERO WIDTH JOINER, ♀ U+2640 FEMALE SIGN) will display as several glyphs and not as a single glyph showing a female construction worker. The same problem occurs for the flag sequences, the family emoji and all other emoji sequences. And the skin tones modifiers are shown as seperate characters following the emoji they are modifying as well.</p><p>If you want to make “Symbola” your preferred font for emoji in all programs and not only in “emoji-picker”, you can edit the fontconfig setup from this example <a href=../../other-files/fonts.conf>example fonts.conf</a> file and move the lines containing “Symbola” above the lines containing “Noto Color Emoji”.

To show related words for a candidate, move up or down in the candidate list using the arrow-up/arrow-down keys or the page-up/page-down keys until the desired emoji is highlighted, then press AltGr+F12 (When AltGr+F12 is pressed before moving in the candidate list, i.e. when no candidate at all is highlighted in the candidate list, the word from the preëdit is used to lookup related words).

You can also add the <code>--user</code> option if you want to install this in the home directory of the user:</p><p><code>pip3 install --user --upgrade google-cloud-speech</code></p><p>And you need to install the Python3 module of pyaudio.

The dictionary at the top of the list has the highest priority and the language of this dictionary is used for Google Speech-to-Text.</p><p>Here you can also see for which languages speech recognition is officially supported. The official list of languages supported by Google Cloud Speech-to-Text is <a href=https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages>here</a>. In the ibus-typing-booster setup tool “Dictionaries and input methods” tab, a row for a language officially supported by Google Speech-to-Text is marked with “Speech recognition ✔️”, a row for a language not officially supported by Google Speech-to-Text is marked with “Speech recognition ❌”.</p><p>In Googles official list, only “de_DE” is supported among the German variants.

When using “de-CH”, it uses “ß” when spelling German words even though “ss” is used in Switzerland instead of “ß”. There seems to be no difference between using Google Speech-to-Text for all these variants of German.</p><p>However, for “en-GB” and “en-US”, there is a difference, the produced text uses British or American spelling depending on which one of these English variants is used.</p><p>I don’t want to disallow using something like “de-CH” for speech recognition just because it is not on the list of officially supported languages. Therefore, I allow all languages to be used for speech recognition. But when a language is not officially supported, I mark it with “Speech recognition ❌” and you can try whether it works well or not.</p><p>When trying to use a language which is really not supported by Google Speech-to-Text, for example “gsw_CH” (Alemannic German in Switzerland), it seems to fall back to American English, i.e. it behaves as if speech recognition for “en_US” were used.</p><p>To switch to a different language for speech recognition you don’t always have to open the setup tool, you can also use key bindings to change the highest priority dictionary, see the commands “next_dictionary” and “previous_dictionary” in the key bindings tab of the setup tool.</p><p>And you can also change the highest priority dictionary by using the Gnome panel (or the panel of your favourite desktop) or the ibus floating panel on non-Gnome desktops.</p><p>To input using speech recognition, press the key which is bound to the command “speech_recognition”. A popup appears near the writing position showing something like “🎙en_GB 🇬🇧: ”. Now speak something and what Google Speech-to-Text recognizes appears in that popup which then may look like “🎙en_GB 🇬🇧: This is the text I have spoken”. When a pause is detected in the voice recording, the speech recognition is finalized and the result is inserted at the writing position.</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
