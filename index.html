<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>ibus-typing-booster is a completion input method to speedup typing.</p>

<p>The project was started in 2010 for Fedora 15. The original purpose
  was to make typing of Indic languages easier and faster by providing
  completion and spell checking suggestions.</p>

<p>Since then ibus-typing-booster has been improved to support many
 other languages as well (most languages except Chinese and Japanese
 are supported).</p>

<p>Recently a the capapility to type different languages at the same
  time without having to switch between languages has been added.</p>
