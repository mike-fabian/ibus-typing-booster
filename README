ibus-typing-booster is a completion input method to speedup typing.

Originally it was forked from ibus-table whose Project Owner &
Developer is Yu Yuwei <acevery@gmail.com>, with contributions from

== Key Bindings ==
Space               Commit the preëdit and send a space to the application,
                    i.e. commit the typed string followed by a space.
Return              Commit the preëdit and send a Return to the application.
Enter               Commit the preëdit and send a Enter to the application.
Tab                 If the option “Enable suggestions by Tab key” is
                    *not* set:
                        “Tab” behaves like “Space”, i.e. it commits
                        the typed string followed by a space.
                    If the option “Enable suggestions by Tab key” is
                    set:
                        “Tab” toggles the display of the candidate list.
                        I.e. it shows the candidate list if it was
                        hidden and hides the candidate list if it was
                        shown.

Escape              Clear preëdit and discard contents.

Left  (Arrow left)  Move cursor one typed key left in the preëdit text.
                    May trigger a commit if the left end of the preëdit
                    is reached.
Control+Left        Move cursor to the left end of the preëdit text.
                    If the cursor is already at the left end of the preëdit
                    text, trigger a commit and send a Control+Left
                    to the application.
Right (Arrow right) Move cursor one typed key right in preëdit text.
                    May trigger a commit if the right end of the preëdit
                    is reached.
Control+Right       Move cursor to the right end of the preëdit text.
                    If the cursor is already at the right end of the preëdit
                    text, trigger a commit and send a Control+Right
                    to the application.
Backspace           Remove the typed key to the left of the cursor in
                    the preëdit text.
Control+Backspace   Remove everything to the left of the cursor in the
                    preëdit text.
Delete              Remove the typed key to the right of the cursor in the
                    preëdit text.
Control+Delete      Remove everything to the right of the cursor in the
                    preëdit text.

Down  (Arrow down)  Select the next candidate.
Up    (Arrow up)    Select the previous candidate.
Page_Up             Show next page of candidates.
Page_Down           Show previous page of candidates.

F1                  Commit the candidate with the label “1”
F2                  Commit the candidate with the label “2”
...
F9                  Commit the candidate with the label “9”
1-9                 Same as F1-F9 if the option “Use digits as select keys”
                    is enabled. This makes selecting candidates a bit easier
                    because the number keys 1-9 are closer to the fingers then
                    F1-F9 on most keyboards. On the other hand, it makes
                    completing when typing numbers impossible and it makes
                    typing strings which are combinations of letters and
                    numbers like “A4” more difficult. If digits are used as
                    select keys, numbers can only be typed when no candidate
                    list is shown. In most cases this means that numbers can
                    only be typed when nothing else has been typed yet and
                    the preëdit is empty.

When more than one input method at the same time is used:

Control+Down        Switch input method used for the preëdit to the
                    next input method
Control+Up          Switch input method used for the preëdit to the
                    previous input method.


== Multilingual input ==

ibus-typing-booster supports using more than one input
method/transliteration at the same time.

For example, if one uses the ibus-typing-booster engine "mr-IN",
i.e. the engine for the Indian language Marathi, one can select one of
the Marathi input methods mr-itrans, mr-phonetic, mr-inscript, and
mr-inscript2 in the setup tool. Keys typed will be transliterated
using the selected transliteration method and looked up in the mr_IN
hunspell dictionary and the user database of previous input.

To add English as a second language to use at the same time, one can
use the checkbox option “Add direct input” in the setup tool. If that
option is selected, direct keyboard input is added as a second input
method and the en_GB (British English) dictionary is added as a second
dictionary in addition to the mr_IN dictionary.

If more than one input/transliteration method is enabled, the typed
keys will will be transliterated with each transliteration
method and each result will be looked up in the enabled dictionaries
and in the user database of previous input.

That way, to type English, one does not have to switch off the Marathi
engine of ibus-typing-booster, one can just type and suitable English
candidates will show up as well in the candidate list. After typing a
few characters, Marathi input is unlikely to match English candidates
and English input is unlikely to match Marathi candidates. This works
even better after ibus-typing-booster has learned a while from the
user input because ibus-typing-booster tries to complete the currently
typed word by also using the last few words typed before as additional
information. Therefore, if the user types a combination of words again
he has already typed previously, the prediction for the currently
typed word will be much better.

Using the setup tool it is currently only possible to add British
English as a second language to the main language of an
ibus-typing-booster engine.

But internally, ibus-typing-booser already supports any combination
of input methods and dictionaries, only the setup tool is not
yet able to set this up. It can be done by setting the
appropriate dconf keys manually though.

Example:

Setting three input/transliteration methods:

    $ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/inputmethod '"mr-itrans,t-latn-post,NoIme"'

sets the three transliteration methods, “mr-itrans” (Marathi Itrans),
“t-latn-post” (A postscript input method to type accented Latin
characters, e.g. typing “u"” will produce “ü”), and “NoIme” (direct
keyboard input without any transliteration).

Setting 3 dictionaries:

    $ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/dictionary='"mr_IN,en_GB,de_DE"'

sets the Marathi, the British English,and the German dictionary.
